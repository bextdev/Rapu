# Rapu
Rapu helps create copies of component, it only copies an instance of it using Reflection, but it doesn't copy the customized looks of the original component

V1.1 Changelog:

Added NEW blocks (Remove, Move & Create)

Changed the name of "Create" (V1 block, copies components dynamically) to "Copy"

V1.2 Changelog:

Changed the name of GetComponentByName to GetComponent, to avoid confusion with <a href="https://community.appinventor.mit.edu/t/how-do-i-get-component-in-java/125378/9">a created extension</a>
